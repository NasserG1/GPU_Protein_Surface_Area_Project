# Advanced GPU-Accelerated Surface Analysis and Visualization of Proteins

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the GPU-accelerated computation of solvent-accessible surface areas (SASA) of protein atoms and the visualization of these computations using PyMOL. By leveraging GPU power through PyCuda, we can efficiently compute surface areas for a large number of atoms in a protein structure, providing deeper insights into protein structure, function, and interactions.

## Motivation

Protein surface analysis is crucial in understanding the interaction of proteins with other molecules, such as ligands, DNA, or other proteins. The solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) is a key metric in this analysis, indicating how much of each atom is exposed to the solvent. This project aims to demonstrate the benefits of GPU acceleration in biological computations, showcasing how complex computations can be made more efficient and how these results can be used to enhance our understanding of protein structures.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **PyCuda**: For GPU-accelerated computation of surface areas.
- **BioPython**: For parsing PDB files and extracting protein atomic data.
- **PyMOL**: For visualization of the protein structures before and after the computations.
- **CUDA**: Nvidia's parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API).
- **Python**: The main programming language used for this project.

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Set Up the Python Environment

It's recommended to create a new Conda environment to manage the dependencies:

```bash
conda create --name gpu_protein_env python=3.10
conda activate gpu_protein_env
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install PyCuda, BioPython, PyMOL, and other necessary libraries.

### 4. Ensure CUDA is Properly Installed

Verify that the CUDA toolkit is installed and properly configured:

- You should have CUDA version 12.6 or higher installed.
- Verify by running:

```bash
nvcc --version
```

- Ensure that Visual Studio (with C++ tools) is installed and configured correctly to work with CUDA.

## Usage

### 1. Prepare the Input Data

- Place your PDB file (e.g., `2c0k.pdb`) in the `data/` directory.
- Update the file paths in `gpu_surface_proteins.py` if necessary.

### 2. Run the Python Script

Execute the main script to perform the GPU-accelerated surface area computation and visualization:

```bash
python src/gpu_surface_proteins.py
```

### 3. View the Results

The script will generate several output files in the `output/` directory:

- `protein_initial.png`: Visualization of the protein structure before surface area computation.
- `protein_surface.png`: Visualization of the protein structure after surface area computation.
- `surface_areas.txt`: A text file containing the computed surface areas for each atom.
- `surface_area_histogram.png`: A histogram showing the distribution of surface areas across atoms.

## Quantitative Analysis

In addition to the visualization, the script performs quantitative analysis of the computed surface areas:

- Identifies atoms with maximum and minimum surface areas.
- Summarizes surface areas by residue to find the residue with the largest surface area.
- Outputs these insights directly in the console during execution.

## Further Improvements

Possible enhancements to this project could include:

- Extending the analysis to include other surface properties like electrostatic potential.
- Implementing more advanced visualization techniques or animations in PyMOL.
- Exploring different protein structures to generalize the findings.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how GPU acceleration can significantly enhance the efficiency of complex biological computations. By integrating PyCuda, BioPython, and PyMOL, we have created a powerful tool for protein surface analysis that combines computational rigor with insightful visualization.
